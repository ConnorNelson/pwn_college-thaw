Overview

Level 5 - LFSR 2

Difficulty:
  Rules: [***] (777 win streak, 2000 rounds)
  Seed:  XXXXX (getentropy)
  PRNG:  [**-] (31-bit LFSR)
]]]

Description
[[[
It's level 4, but harder! The LFSR's period is 2**31-1 so you can't exploit
that, and the seed is also unpredictable. The algorithm is the same though,
so if you solved 4 just the right way, all it's going to take here is 
adjusting a few variables!
]]]

Intended approach
[[[
The LFSR's length and the taps' positions are the only things you have to
adjust if your implementation is generic enough.
]]]

Bonus hint
[[[
LFSRs with simple ratios between the length and tap positions can generate
really funky patterns when you print the results out in two dimensions!
That's why this challenge uses prime numbers for those :)
