Welcome to "The House Always Wins!"

This dojo is centered around PRNGs (Pseudo-Random Number Generators)
and the exploitation of the "pseudo" part.

If you have any experience with reverse-engineering and want to learn
by doing, feel free to stop reading now and go dig around in the bins - 
all main challenges should be solvable without any guidance!

If you get stuck and need a hint, or want to learn more about the
intended approach and the concepts behind it - each challenge has a
series of encrypted hints. Dectypting them is easy:

>$ echo "aGFpIGhld3dvdSBpbWEgaGludCA6Mwo=" | base64 -d
           ^^^ that's the enctypted hint in base64

In any case, good luck!

Overview
[[[
Level 1 - Tutorial

Difficulty:
  Rules: [*--] (10 win streak, 2000 rounds)
  Seed:  XXXXX (getentropy)
  PRNG:  [***] (LAF)
]]]

Description
[[[
The first level is introductory - all you need to do is win 10 times
in a row! With chances being 50/50, that should take around 2048 tries
on average. The 2000 round limit might trip you up a bit, but you can
retry the challenge as much as you want.
]]]

Intended approach
[[[
The PRNG in this level is quite strong, and the seed (initial state) is
practically uncrackable. The win condition is easy enough though, thus...

Bruteforce! This level is mostly here to help you automate the interactions
through something like pwntools for Python. While you, technically, can
solve every challenge in the main dojo with pen, paper and power of will,
automation is expected and not considered cheating.

Feeding any valid input ('1' or '0' in ASCII + newline) 2000 times should
do the trick!

Algorithms and implementation details 
[[[
Linear Additive Feedback random number generator is a slightly adjusted
(literally 1 bit of difference) version of the glibc's default rand()
The details and reasons for them will be discussed later...

getentropy() calls getrandom() under the hood, which reads from the same
source as /dev/urandom. If you happen to crack it - expect global chaos.

Sources:
man 3 random
man 3 getentropy
man 2 getrandom
