Level 2 - Fixed seed attack

Difficulty:
  Rules: [***] (777 win streak, 2000 rounds)
  Seed:  [*--] (fixed)
  PRNG:  XXXXX (LAF but stronger)
]]]

Description
[[[
The second level requires some actual RNG exploitation!
Most RNGs are just a complicated formula that outputs numbers that
only seem random. They require a "seed" value - the first value
that's going to influence every number generated by the RNG.
If the seed value is the same, the generated numbers will also
be the same every time.

Case in point - Minecraft! You can generate the same random world
as long as you know the seed.

Intended approach
[[[
The algorithm itself doesn't give you enough information about its
internal state to attack it, so focus on exploiting the fixed seed.

If you do find a way to attack the algorithm let me know though;)
]]]

Hint 1
[[[
The seed is unique for everyone because it is based on your /flag.
This also means that a hardcoded solution for practice mode will
not work in challenge mode because the flags are different!
]]]

Hint 2
[[[
The intended solution requires restarting the challenge program once.
]]]

Hint 3
[[[
This challenge is also supposed to teach you to store outputs - you'll
be doing that a lot in future challenges.
