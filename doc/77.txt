Level 77 - Plot Twist

Difficulty:
  Rules: [**-] (777 win streak, 30000 rounds)
  Seed:  XXXXX (getentropy)
  PRNG:  [****](MT19937)
]]]

Description
[[[
Mersenne Twister, aka MT19937
First of all, one of the cooler PRNG names.
And the coolness doesn't stop there!
It's used everywhere - Python's random, for example.
And there's a reason: it's Quite Good!
8/10 algo, like it a lot, will use again.

Implementation details
[[[
This challenge implements the MT19937 variant - the standard.
The object names have are exported so the variable names you'll
see in some decompilers will be the same as in most sources.
]]]

Intended approach
[[[
While looking at the source code was kinda implied as an option before, it's
more or less expected in this one - /challenge/77.c was written to be read.
(the others were written to just work lol). Since most descriptions delve into
details that are outside of our scope (cracking), the code has been simplified
and commented relatively thoroughly.

Though the algorithm itself may seem intimidating at first, the approach is
the same as before - read some outputs, deduce the internal state, predict.

Hints
[[[
The biggest new thing we're interested in is the tempering process. While
tricky, full "untempering" is totally possible and will allow you to recover
the number that's directly written to the state array. You know what to do
from there ;)
