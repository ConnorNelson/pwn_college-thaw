Level 777 - The DLC

Description
[[[
Xoroshiro one-two-eight... Plus.
ngl the name is half the reason i chose it
proper final boss name right there
10/10, but only if you pronounce xoro as zoro
Its name has an actual meaning, too!
XOR - ROtate - SHIft - ROtate
Rotate operation is as simple as the other two
Think you can handle this one? }:3

Approach
[[[
Alright, the previous section's tone may seem a bit disingenuous after you put
some time into solving this challenge. The thing is, while it *is* definitely
solvable, in theory, I haven't found a good way to do it.

What's a "good" way? The kind that was intended in the previous challs. Taking
apart the algorithm, understanding it thoroughly and deterministically solving
the thing like a fancy math equation. For this one, unfortunately, I couldn't
find any public solutions that would reverse it this way. The only relatively
reliable solution involves using z3.

z3 is a magic tool where you can stuff some numbers and it will give you the
answer. Well, may. About 50/50 chance in my tests. The exact kind of magic it
employs makes me feel dumb and is absolutely beyond this module's already
stretched scope. And even then it can't find the solution reliably!

The thing is, a deterministic solution *IS* possible, and even incredibly easy
to implement! Just bruteforce the 128 bit state... aint nobody got time for dat

If you do solve this one, take a look at the next section.

The True End
[[[
Level 7777777

Difficulty:
  Rules: [******777 win streak, 1000 rounds, 777 times)
  Seed:  XXXXX (getentropy)
  PRNG:  [*****]xoroshiro128+)

  The state must reset after each full win streak.
  Only a deterministic solution will work.
